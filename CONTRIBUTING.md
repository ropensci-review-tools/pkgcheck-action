# Contributing to pkgcheck-action

## Opening issues

The easiest way to note any behavioural curiosities or to request any new
features is by opening a [github
issue](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action/issues).


## Development guidelines

If you'd like to contribute changes to `pkgcheck-action`, we use [the GitHub
flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for proposing,
submitting, reviewing, and accepting changes. If you haven't done this before,
there's a nice [overview of git](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html), as well
as [best practices for submitting pull requests](http://r-pkgs.org/git.html#pr-make)
in the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.

`pkgcheck-action` uses the [the commonly used tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#spacing). Tools like [`styler`](https://styler.r-lib.org/) and [`lintr`](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr) can make it easier to adhere to this style.

All(75%+) new code should be covered by unit test using [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/index.html) 3rd edition.

## Code of Conduct

We want to encourage a warm, welcoming, and safe environment for contributing to
this project. See the [code of
conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) for
more information.
